In line with integrating a 'delete' option for our users, I think adding in a revisions feature for the django admin
would be beneficial. A revisions feature could track changes and make sure that you could undo deletes or other large
changes that a human might make by accident, user or admin.

from django.contrib import admin

class YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    actions = ['undo_delete']

    def undo_delete(self, request, queryset):
        queryset.update(is_deleted=False)  # Restore soft-deleted items
        self.message_user(request, "Undo successful for selected items.")

    undo_delete.short_description = "Undo delete"

admin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)

The django-simple-history library can do something similar and would be less code required by the admin to maintain.
